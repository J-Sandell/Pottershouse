					<h2>Pastor's Story</h2>
					<p>My name is Billy Perez. I am the pastor at the Potter's House church in South Carson City on Fairview Dr. I got saved in 2009  in Reno, NV after years of living in sin. I got involved with gangs at the young age of 12, because I was following the footsteps of my brother and cousins. Even though I was Raised in church and had a mother who seved  God, I rejected that in favor of drugs and gang life. As I got older, gang life got worse and worse. I came close to losing my life, I was in and out of county jail, and I watched my friends get locked up and some even die. At the age of 29 I was at a crossroads. I was in a dark spot and saw that my life had nothing to show for it. Five years previously, my sister had gotten saved. She and her husband had been preaching to me and trying to get me saved as well. I finally realized that I was done with the gang and drug lifestyle. I was ready to give my life to Jesus. The day I came to church and got saved, my pastor presented a challenge. He challenged new believers to wholly serve God for 6 months, an if after 6 months I had nothing to show for it I could walk away. He knew I would never walk away, because it is impossible to not come out changed after being fully devoted to serving God. Now 13 years later I am preaching the gospel. I have a solid family, and my life is blessed.</p>

					<h2>Wife's Story</h2>
					<p>My name is Brooke Perez. My husband is the pastor at the Potter's House Church in South Carson City on Fairview Dr. i got saved when I was 14 years old. MY parents were saved before I was born and my dad became a pastor in Seattle, when i was 2 years old. I was raised in a happy and healthy home, that was blessed by God. Even thought I had seen how living in sin destroyed lives, I had yet to experience it. When I was 12, my family became missionaries to Zambia. This was the beginning of my personal spiritual journey. I got the full realization that I needed my own personal relationship with Jesus when I was 14. At the age of 18, I left Zambia and went to UNR. I was excited to serve God on my own; and make my own way to church rather than go simply because there was no other option. I had high expectations, but the devil had tactics I was not prepared for. I was soon disappointed, and at the age of 21, I told God that i didn't believe that He could make me happy. I almost immediately began to fall into sin. In the next 3 moths I experienced a life without the covering of God and quicly realized that it was not worthit. I rededicated my life to Jesus and I have benn serving Him ever since. Living for God's expectations greatly exceeded any expectations I could have had for myself.
