					<h2>Pastor's Story</h2>
					<p>My name is Billy Perez. I am the pastor at the Potter's House church in South Carson City on Fairview Dr. I got saved in 2009  in Reno, NV after years of living in sin. I got involved with gangs at the young age of 12, because I was following the footsteps of my brother and cousins. Even though I was Raised in church and had a mother who seved  God, I rejected that in favor of drugs and gang life. As I got older, gang life got worse and worse. I came close to losing my life, I was in and out of county jail, and I watched my friends get locked up and some even die. At the age of 29 I was at a crossroads. I was in a dark spot and saw that my life had nothing to show for it. Five years previously, my sister had gotten saved. She and her husband had been preaching to me and trying to get me saved as well. I finally realized that I was done with the gang and drug lifestyle. I was ready to give my life to Jesus. The day I came to church and got saved, my pastor presented a challenge. He challenged new believers to wholly serve God for 6 months, an if after 6 months I had nothing to show for it I could walk away. He knew I would never walk away, because it is impossible to not come out changed after being fully devoted to serving God. Now 13 years later I am preaching the gospel. I have a solid family, and my life is blessed.</p>
